# Advice for Applying to Grad School in Economics

On this webpage you will find a short summary of things you should do if you are considering advanced degrees in economics. - What Courses to take to prepare for Grad School? - What Graduate programs are available? - Some advice for graduate school?

## Graduate School Types
An undergraduate degree prepares you for many different types of graduate school programs.
Here is a short list
- MA, MS, or PhD in Economics
- Master in Environmental Science
- Master in Public Health
- Masters in Public Policy
- Masters in Urban Planning
- Masters in Business Administration
- Law School, JD
- Data Analytics

## Choosing classes
- Graduate schools care much more about what hard classes you've taken and how you've done in them than about overall GPA.
- If you have taken difficult classes its probably a good idea to point this out in your application essay because schools might not know what the math classes are, which economics classes are the advanced ones, etc.
- And while we are on the subject, take Math! As much Math as possible if you are considering a PhD. It is recommended you complete the Calculus Sequence (Calculus I - III) and Linear Algebra. Also recommended, but not required are upper levels in Probability, Statistics, and Real Analysis. Here is what the American Economics Association recommends.
- For MA degrees, the math requirement is less stringent. Calculus I-II, Linear Algebra, and some quantitative Economics Electives.
- Below you will find a list of suggested courses depending on your interest.
