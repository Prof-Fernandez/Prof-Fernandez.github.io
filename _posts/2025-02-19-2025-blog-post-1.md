# Expected Child earnings
Most parents hope that their child will be better than them financially. There is empirical evidence to support this belief. A recent article in *Empirical Economics* estimated child rank versus parental rank across three countries: Chile, Canada, and the United States.

Cortes-Orihuela et al (2024) find significant nonlinearities in their measures; intergenerational mobility is very high in the bottom 80% of the parents’ distribution and bottom 65% of the children’s distribution (i.e. kids do better than their parents), but with remarkably high persistence in the upper part of the earnings distribution (parents do better than kids). They also find statistically significant heterogeneity by gender. There is a persistent male-female gap in rank unitl the 80th percentile of the parental rank. The gap is decreasing with maternal income earned.

In this post, we will do something much simpler. We will look at data from the PSID. The Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) is the longest running longitudinal household survey in the world. The study began in 1968 with a nationally representative sample of over 18,000 individuals living in 5,000 families in the United States. Information on these individuals and their descendants has been collected continuously, including data covering employment, income, wealth, expenditures, health, marriage, childbearing, child development, philanthropy, education, and numerous other topics. Over 7,600 peer-reviewed publications have been based on the PSID.

In 2007, the PSID asked a question to the parents:
*When your (child/oldest child/next oldest child/third oldest child) is in his or her prime earning years, do you expect his or her household's earnings to be higher or lower than your household's earnings at comparable ages? Would you say much higher, somewhat higher, the same, somewhat lower, or much lower?*
This question serves as a good use case for "stacked percentage bar chart". The reasons is that the number of children per family vary. Therefore, non-response can make it difficult to make quick comparisions across groups. In this case, we are interested in if the perception changes depending on birth order.

[Number of Children per family](https://news.gallup.com/poll/511238/americans-preference-larger-families-highest-1971.aspx#:~:text=In%20all%2C%2031%25%20of%20U.S.,and%20three%20children%20is%20ideal.)
- One child: 14% of US adults had one child in 2023
- Two children: 28% of US adults had two children in 2023
- Three children: 15% of US adults had three children in 2023
- Four or more children: 7% of US adults had four or more children
- No children: 31% of US adults had no children
