In this post, I continue a series of visualizations using IPUMS data about Economics Majors. Here we compare the median personal income by age for economics majors using the 2023 American Community Survey. 

You will need an account on IPUMS to complete this project. In the code below, I provide a link to the data I am using in case you do not want to generate the data yourself.

[We will be using the IPUMS online tool to obtain the data](https://usa.ipums.org/usa/sda/)

```r
# creates a population pyramid
# apyramid helps us make these graphs relatively easily
library(apyramid)
# ggplot2 helps us create the labels.
library(ggplot2)
# load sample data 
means <- read.csv("github.com/Prof-Fernandez/Prof-Fernandez.github.io/files//means (1).csv")
# Your x variable must be a factor variable
means$age <- factor(means$age)
flup <- age_pyramid(means, age, split_by = gender, count = population)
flup +  labs(x = "Age (years)",y = "Median Personal Income", fill = "Gender", 
             title = "Income by Age among Economics Majors")
```
