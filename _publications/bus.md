# Abstract
Through its National Center for Transit Research, and under contract with the Florida Department of Transportation, the Center for Urban Transportation Research (CUTR) was tasked with reviewing a sample of data on transit bus crash occurrence from selected Florida transit systems. The purpose of this review is to analyze changes in crash occurrence over time in relation to the effectiveness of training programs and capital safety improvements in reducing bus crashes. To this end, CUTR conducted two case studies utilizing occurrence data from Hillsborough Area Regional Transit Authority in Tampa (which implemented a refresher training course for bus operators) and LYNX Transit in Orlando (which replaced standard rear-end brake lights and turn signal and emergency flasher lights with high-density LED lights). The case studies examined the effect that these two particular safety campaigns had on postimple-mentation bus crash occurrence for the two properties. In addition to the promotion of safety, it is anticipated that this effort will be a preliminary step in the process of establishing a general list of safety campaigns, along with related costs and “rule of thumb” occurrence prevention effectiveness levels for each. A list of this nature will aid transit systems in Florida, the United States, and elsewhere in the selection of safety campaigns that will meet financial and safety goals.
