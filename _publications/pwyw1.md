# Abstract
Using a game theoretic framework, we show that not only can pay-what-you-want pricing generate positive profits, but it can also be more profitable than charging a fixed price to all consumers. Further, whenever it is more profitable, it is also Pareto-improving. We derive conditions in terms of two cost parameters, namely the marginal cost parameter for the seller, and the social preference parameter of a consumer to incorporate behavioral considerations for paying too little compared to her reference price.
