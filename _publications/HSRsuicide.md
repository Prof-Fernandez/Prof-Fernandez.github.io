title: "Are suicides underreported? The impact of coroners versus medical examiners on suicide reporting."
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/HSRsuicide
excerpt: 'Medical examiners are trained appointed physicians. Coroners are often elected individuals with no medical training but serve 80% of the population. Both determine suicide counts in the United States. Suicide is a leading cause of death in the United States. Researchers believe suicide rates are underreported by 15%â€“50% internationally. Differences in medical training may account for this discrepancy. We used a staggered difference-in-differences approach and found coroner-only states underreported share of suicides by 17.4% and performed 20.4% fewer autopsies compared to states with county coroners and a state medical examiner.'
