title: "Are suicides underreported? The impact of coroners versus medical examiners on suicide reporting."

excerpt: 'Medical examiners are trained appointed physicians. Coroners are often elected individuals with no medical training but serve 80% of the population. Both determine suicide counts in the United States. Suicide is a leading cause of death in the United States. Researchers believe suicide rates are underreported by 15%–50% internationally. Differences in medical training may account for this discrepancy. We used a staggered difference-in-differences approach and found coroner-only states underreported share of suicides by 17.4% and performed 20.4% fewer autopsies compared to states with county coroners and a state medical examiner.'

# Abstract
## Objective
To evaluate if state death investigation systems affect the reporting of suicides, particularly when comparing medical examiners to coroners.

## Data Sources and Study Setting
We used restricted-access state mortality data from National Vital Statistics System between the years 1959 to 2016. These data were matched with state-level changes in death investigation systems reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention database on the Public Health Law Program: Coroner/ME Laws.

## Study Design
We used difference-in-differences and event study methods for the analysis. We estimated the relative per capita changes in suicides, accidental deaths, and homicides when comparing coroner-only states with other death investigation types. Sub-analyses estimated differences by sex, race, and if coroners were required to receive training.

## Data Collection/Extraction Methods
Not Applicable.

## Principal Findings
Coroners-only states underreported suicides by 17.4% (p < 0.05) and performed 20.4% (p < 0.05) fewer autopsies compared to states with county coroners and a state medical examiner. This pattern is consistent by sex and race. Required coroner training did not affect death determination significantly.

## Conclusion
Coroners-only states underreported suicides compared to states with county coroners and a state medical examiner. The disparity in the use of autopsies is a potential mechanism for underreporting of suicides by coroners. If all coroners-only states adopted a state medical examiner, suicide reporting would increase by 2243–3100 deaths in the United States annually.
